            Hi, I&apos;m Kayla Van Bortel! I&apos;m a writer passionate about storytelling and creative expression. 
            I have been writing and researching the craft for years and now I&apos;m pursuing a Creative Writing minor
            and hunting down any writing groups I can. I&apos;m dedicated to 
            crafting compelling narratives that resonate with readers and transport them to worlds as lively as the
            ones that live in my mind.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            When I&apos;m not writing, you can find me exploring local bookstores, camping in the Adirondacks, 
            skiing (whether on snow or water), playing soccer, or sitting in front of a glowing screen, a blanket
            wrapped around my shoulders, typing into terminal windows and my IDE of choice.
            I believe that every experience feeds into the stories we tellâ€”and what a freeing rule that is to live by.
          </p>
